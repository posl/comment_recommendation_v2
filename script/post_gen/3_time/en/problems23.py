Suggestion 5

def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:
        # The idea is to use the pigs to represent the digits of a number in a different base.
        # For example, if we have 4 pigs, we can represent up to 4^4 buckets with 4 digits in base 4.
        # So, if we have 1000 buckets, we need 5 pigs to represent them in base 5 (5^5 = 3125 > 1000).
        # The number of digits in base b required to represent n numbers is ceil(log_b(n)).
        # So, the number of pigs we need is ceil(log_b(n)), where b = 1 + minutesToTest / minutesToDie.
        # This is the same as ceil(log(n) / log(b)).
        # We can use the change-of-base formula to convert this to log(n) / log(b).
        # Since we need to return an integer, we use math.ceil.
        # The change-of-base formula is log_b(n) = log(n) / log(b).
        # So, we have log(n) / log(1 + minutesToTest / minutesToDie).
        # This can be simplified to log(n) / log(1 + minutesToTest // minutesToDie).
        # The // operator performs integer division.
        return math.ceil(math.log(buckets) / math.log(1 + minutesToTest // minutesToDie))

        # The idea is to use the pigs to represent the binary number, for example, if we have 4 pigs, then we can use 4 bits to represent 16 buckets, and we can use 5 bits to represent 32 buckets.
        # The formula is: buckets = (minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1) ^ pigs, so we can get the number of pigs: pigs = log(buckets) / log(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1)
