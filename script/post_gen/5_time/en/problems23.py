Suggestion 5

    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:
        #If we have 1 pig, then it can test 5 buckets (because 5 minutes is greater than 4 minutes).
        #If we have 2 pigs, then we can test 25 buckets (5 minutes for 1st pig, 5 minutes for 2nd pig).
        #If we have 3 pigs, then we can test 125 buckets (5 minutes for 1st pig, 5 minutes for 2nd pig, 5 minutes for 3rd pig).
        #If we have 4 pigs, then we can test 625 buckets (5 minutes for 1st pig, 5 minutes for 2nd pig, 5 minutes for 3rd pig, 5 minutes for 4th pig).
        #If we have 5 pigs, then we can test 3125 buckets (5 minutes for 1st pig, 5 minutes for 2nd pig, 5 minutes for 3rd pig, 5 minutes for 4th pig, 5 minutes for 5th pig).
        #So, if we have 6 pigs, then we can test 15625 buckets (5 minutes for 1st pig, 5 minutes for 2nd pig, 5 minutes for 3rd pig, 5 minutes for 4th pig, 5 minutes for 5th pig, 5 minutes for 6th pig).
        #And so on...
        #So, we need to find the minimum number of pigs, such that we can test all the buckets within minutesToTest minutes.
        #So, we need to find the smallest x such that (minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1) ^ x >= buckets.
        #We can use logarithms to solve this problem.
        #log((minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1) ^ x) = log(buckets)
        #x * log(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1) = log(buckets)
        #x = log(buckets) / log(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1)
        #x = ceil(log(buckets) / log(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1))
        #return math.ceil(math.log(buckets) / math.log(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1))
