    # The number of s2's in s1 is the number of
    # times s2 can be repeated in s1
    # This can be done by using a hashmap to keep track
    # of the number of times s2 is repeated in s1
    # and the index at which it is repeated
    # If the index is already present in the hashmap
    # then the pattern repeats and we can find the
    # length of the pattern and the number of times
    # the pattern repeats
    # We can then use this information to find the
    # number of times s2 can be repeated in s1
    # and then divide that number by n2
    # to get the number of times s2 can be repeated
    # in s1
